RedRepublicOld
==============

The Red Republic project from 2007. I wrote this when I was just about fresh out of high school so the code is not very good. It's still better than MafiaMatrix though.

I've released it under the GNU GPL license, so it's completely open source. If you want to do something commercial with it, contact me.
