 </div>
 <div class="content">
 <p>Red Republic is in many aspects a revolutionary game, in the sense that it offers features that you will find in very few other online text based games. Red Republic simulates a modern world society that plays mainly in six large cities in Europe. The citizens of these cities have a wide array of careers they can practise, but all efforts are supposed to aid your country in both war and peace. The law system, the making of international treaties, everything is made as realistic as possible, and therefore we also have a fully featured 'dark side' - the criminal path you can take!
 There is much to discover, and because of some unique features (that will be listed below) the game will ensure a maximum playing experience for a lengthy period of time!</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 10px;">Red Republic Careers</div>
 </div>
 <div class="content">
	<p>Red Republic aims to feature many careers, while also providing very in-depth careers. We intend to weed out any 'filler careers' should they rise during the development process; it is our philosophy that any career should allow characters to play to their strengths and offer them the chance to become a powerful character. The following careers and their ranks are only an indication of how we think the game should be structured and they may change over time. We highly value user feedback, and any well thought-out ideas may just make it to this page!</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 10px;">Other features</div>
 </div>
 <div class="content">
	<p>Other than our item system and careers we have a lot of other small features that distinguishes us from other games. Some of them are listed here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Random diseases. Every now and then you will catch a cold or worse and need to visit a doctor!
		<li>A courthouse with options varying from applying for jobs to watching paintings!
		<li>An auction house, which effectively adds a player controlled economy!
	</ul>
	<strong>Note:</strong><br />
	<p>The game is currently under development and therefore closed. This means that you currently can't access the game until you are specifically asked to do so (or you asked us). When we will move into beta testing we will open the game for a limited number of players, and only at the release everyone can register!</p>
